(Assumes that ##C-z## is your control chord)

    C-z [ Start Move (move with keys)
    
    [SPACE] begin select (move with keys)
    [SPACE] end select

Now you can:

    C-z > puts it in bufferfile (/tmp/screen-exchange)
    C-z ] pastes it in

To suck up into hold spaces what's in bufferfile:

    C-z <

== Use a different bufferfile ==

Change the filename used for reading and writing with the paste buffer. The
default is <tt>/tmp/screen-exchange</tt>.

        C-z: bufferfile /etc/passwd
        C-z < C-z ]
        C-z : bufferfile

Sucks up /etc/passwd into buffer space.

== Remove bufferfile ==

Unlink the screen-exchange file

       C-z =
