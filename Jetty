=== Setting cookies ===

Set the version of the cookie to greater than 0, and it won't encode the cookie.  Handy if you want to put a new line in the cookie.

    Cookie c = new Cookie("foo",
        java.net.URLEncoder.encode("foo" + "\n" + "bar","UTF-8"));
    c.setVersion(1);  // RFC 2109 cookie specficiation
    ...
    response.addCookie(c);
