Tips and tricks for scripting in unix.

== Test if file name matches ==

  # assume $x holds filename like './foobar/foo/sedscr"
  if echo "$x" | grep -q "sedscr"; then
      echo "Contains the text sedscr in name";
  else
      echo "Doesn't contain sedscr in name";
  fi

== Echo to stderr ==

Why can't I remember this one? Perhaps typing it here will help.

   echo "foo" 1>&2

== Ouput with here docs ==

  cat << EOF >&2
  this is a line
  this is another line
  EOF

== getopts example ==

  while getopts "hw:" opt; do
        case $opt in
             h ) hyph=1          ;;
             w ) width="$OPTARG" ;;
        esac
  done
  shift $(($OPTIND - 1)) # so we can get the other args (e.g. $1)

== eval text ==

  % eval $(date "+weekday=\"%a\"")
  % echo $weekday
  Mon
