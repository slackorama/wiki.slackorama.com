== Start up rxvt instead of standard cygwin ==

     rxvt -g 100x50+130+100 -e /bin/bash --login -i
            100 - windows width
            50  - windows height
            130 - start X
            100 - start Y
    

== Remove case sensibility in command-line completion under bash ==
Add to ~/.bashrc

    shop -s nocaseglob

Add to ~/.inputrc

    set completion-ignore-case on

== How do I access the C: disk from cygwin? ==

From cygwin, you can get to the C: disk as /cygdrive/c/.
For example, if you want to see the directories and
files in the C: drive, do:

     > ls /cygdrive/c

To get to the "Program Files" directory in the C: drive, do:

    > cd /cygdrive/c/"Program Files"

If you have a Z: drive as well, then you refer to it
as /cygdrive/z.

I like this permanent solution: create a directory for each
of your disks and mount them:

    > cd /
    > mkdir c
    > mount c: /c
    > mkdir d
   > mount d: /d
    > ...etc

Now you can directly go to the c: drive, for example:

    > cd /c  

But WE DO NOT RECOMMEND creating and mounting "/a" above
since "ls /" will typically fail as "a:" and generate an ugly
sound when there is no floppy in "a:".


== Installing cron as a service on XP ==
    cygrunsrv -I cron -p /usr/sbin/cron -a -D

== Resize window in rxvt ==
     echo -ne '\e[8;${rows};${cols}t'".

== Printing to a windows networked server ==
     lpr -d\\\\lantsvc1\\trix

== Getting matchit.vim to work in vi ==
I had to add the following line to my .vimrc to get matchit to work properly
in cygwin

     filetype plugin index on

== Running a command from windows ==
In this example we run [vi]

      C:\cygwin\bin\rxvt -e vim
