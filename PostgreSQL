== Creating a database and a user ==

This is for a Debian based system that'll use your username to connect.

      > sudo -u postgres sh
      $ createuser -DRS smason
      $ createdb -O smason testdb
      $ quit

Then, assuming you are logged in as 'smason', you can just run:

     > psql testdb

Here's how to create a user that will use a password:

    $ createuser -P -S -D -R -e django
    Enter password for new role: ....
    Enter it again: ....

Then, to login you'll need to use:

    > psql -h 127.0.0.1 -U django testdb
