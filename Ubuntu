    dpkg -L packagename

== See which package provided a file  ==

Using the ##-S## option with ##dpkg## directly is a really simple way to find out what package provided the file or executable youâ€™re looking for.

    cedwards@monkey:~$ dpkg -S $(which host)
    bind9-host: /usr/bin/host

Then, on the new system:

   dpkg --set-selections < ~/installed_packages
   apt-get -u dselect-upgrade
